# provision-gcp-project.sh — one-shot GCP project setup for Agile Flow GCP.
#
# Creates a GCP project (optional), enables required APIs, creates an
# Artifact Registry repo, creates a deployer service account with the
# minimum required roles, and optionally generates a service account JSON
# key for workshop use.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/provision-gcp-project.sh [--create-project] [--with-sa-key]
#
# Environment variables:
#   GCP_PROJECT_ID       (required) Project ID to provision into
#   GCP_REGION           (default: us-central1)
#   ARTIFACT_REPO        (default: agile-flow)
#   BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID   (required if --create-project)
#   GITHUB_OWNER         (optional) GitHub owner of the participant's
#                        fork. Personal username (alice-gh) or org (acme).
#                        Required to enable Step 5.5 (WIF setup).
#   GITHUB_REPO          (default: agile-flow-gcp) Repo name within
#                        GITHUB_OWNER. Set when participants fork into
#                        an org and rename the repo for their product.
#   GITHUB_USERNAME      Legacy alias for GITHUB_OWNER. When GITHUB_OWNER
#                        is unset, the script uses GITHUB_USERNAME as the
#                        owner. Existing callers don't need to change.
#   NEON_API_KEY         (optional) Enables Step 5.7 (Neon branch +
#                        database-url Secret Manager). Required for
#                        per-attendee branch automation.
#   NEON_PROJECT_ID      (optional) Same: required for Step 5.7.
#   NEON_BRANCH_NAME     (optional) Same: required for Step 5.7.
#                        Wrapper sets this from the CSV's neon_branch
#                        column (defaults to handle).
#   BUDGET_CAP_USD       (optional) Enables Step 5.6 (per-project billing
#                        budget with 50/90/100% thresholds + forecast).
#                        When set, BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID is also required.
#                        The runner needs roles/billing.costsManager on
#                        the billing account. When unset, step is skipped.
#   GITHUB_REPOSITORY    (optional) `<owner>/<repo>` of the participant's
#                        fork (e.g. `acme/widget-shop`). Enables Step 7,
#                        which pushes GCP_PROJECT_ID, GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT,
#                        GCP_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_PROVIDER, and (when Neon
#                        is configured) NEON_PARENT_BRANCH directly into
#                        the fork's Actions secrets via `gh secret set`.
#                        Requires `gh` on PATH and authenticated. When
#                        either is missing, the script falls back to
#                        printing the values for manual entry.
#
# Notes:
# - This script is idempotent. Re-running skips resources that already exist.
# - `--with-sa-key` generates a long-lived service account key. Use for
#   workshops only. For production, set up Workload Identity Federation
#   separately (see docs/PLATFORM-GUIDE.md Step 5).
#
# After running, paste the output into your GitHub repo's secrets panel.

# constraint, on by default for Cloud Identity Free orgs), every
# subsequent IAM binding to an external-domain identity (Gmail, other
# Workspace) fails with FAILED_PRECONDITION. Override per project:
# allValues=ALLOW so any Google identity can be a binding member.
# Production projects in the same org keep their constraint.
#
# This is a list constraint, NOT a boolean — `disable-enforce` does not
# work; `set-policy` with the explicit listPolicy form does. See
# docs/PATTERN-LIBRARY.md pattern #30.
#
# Decision logic: read the project's `describe` output. If listPolicy
# already resolves to ALLOW (override in place), skip. Otherwise apply
# the override unconditionally — the `set-policy` call is itself
# idempotent on a project that already has the same allValues, so no
# harm in always running it on a non-ALLOW project. The earlier
# `org-policies list` probe was unreliable: org-inherited constraints
# don't always appear in the project's list view, so workshop projects
# under an org with the constraint set at the org level were silently
# left without the override and failed at the first external-domain
# IAM binding (e.g. roles/editor to a Gmail account).

#                    a personal username (alice-gh) or an organization
#                    (acme). Required to enable Step 5.5.
#   GITHUB_REPO      The repo name within the owner. Defaults to
#                    'agile-flow-gcp' when unset.
#   GITHUB_USERNAME  Legacy alias for GITHUB_OWNER. Used when GITHUB_OWNER
#                    is unset, so external callers that set the older

#
# Together they identify the GitHub repo whose Actions runs are trusted
# to impersonate the deployer SA. Owners with org forks can rename their
# repo (acme/widget-shop) and the binding still works because the
# wrapper passes both fields explicitly.
#
# Google requires --attribute-condition on OIDC providers (it must
# reference at least one provider claim). We use a trivially-true
# condition (`assertion.repository != ''`) so the provider doesn't gate
# access by org or repo — attendees may fork under any GitHub account
# or org. Trust scoping happens at the IAM binding layer instead, where

# ── Step 5.7: Neon branch + database-url Secret Manager ─────────────────
#
# Creates a per-attendee Neon branch and writes its pooled connection
# string to the Secret Manager secret `database-url` in this GCP project.
# Cloud Run mounts that secret as DATABASE_URL at runtime.
#
# Gated on NEON_API_KEY, NEON_PROJECT_ID, and NEON_BRANCH_NAME being set.
# When any is unset, the step is skipped and the participant must create
# the secret by hand (the script's "Next steps" footer notes this).
#
# Idempotency:
#   - Branch already exists → fetch its pooled URI; do NOT recreate or
#     reparent (per design decision: workshops are short-lived; drift
#     against `main` is not checked).
#   - Secret already exists with same value → no-op.
#   - Secret exists with different value → add a new version.
#
# Connection URIs are sensitive (they include credentials). They are
# never logged to stdout/stderr; only written to Secret Manager.
