## Bootstrap Phase 1: Product Definition

Guide the user through a structured questionnaire to define their product. Ask questions ONE AT A TIME and wait for responses before proceeding.

## Instructions for the Agent

**IMPORTANT: Follow this exact question sequence. Do not skip or combine questions.**

For multiple-choice questions, present numbered options and ask the user to respond with the number OR type their own answer.

---

## Pre-Check: Research Artifacts

Before starting the questionnaire, check for these files:
- `docs/MARKET-RESEARCH.md`
- `docs/JOBS-TO-BE-DONE.md`
- `docs/POSITIONING-ANALYSIS.md`

**If any are found**, tell the user which artifacts were found. Example:
> "I found 2 research artifacts: Market Research and JTBD Analysis. I'll pre-populate several questions from these — you can confirm or override each one."

**Pre-population mapping** — for each question below, if the source artifact exists, show the pre-filled answer and ask "Is this correct? (yes to confirm, or type to override)":

| Question | Source Artifact | Section |
|----------|----------------|---------|
| Q0.1 (domain) | MARKET-RESEARCH.md | Product Concept |
| Q0.2 (value proposition) | POSITIONING-ANALYSIS.md | Positioning Statement |
| Q2.1 (problem) | JOBS-TO-BE-DONE.md | Core Job Statement + Pain Points |
| Q2.2 (who has problem) | POSITIONING-ANALYSIS.md | Best-Fit Customer |
| Q2.3 (current solutions) | POSITIONING-ANALYSIS.md | Competitive Alternatives |
| Q3.1 (primary user) | POSITIONING-ANALYSIS.md | Best-Fit Customer |
| Q3.2 (pain point) | JOBS-TO-BE-DONE.md | Underserved Needs |
| Q3.3 (secondary users) | MARKET-RESEARCH.md | Target Audience Insights |
| Q6.1 (competitors) | MARKET-RESEARCH.md | Competitor Analysis |
| Q6.2 (differentiator) | POSITIONING-ANALYSIS.md | Unique Attributes |

**If no artifacts are found**, proceed normally. Mention that running `/research`, `/jtbd`, and `/positioning` first would produce higher-quality results, but they are not required.

## Tips for Users

1. **Be specific** - Vague answers lead to vague products
2. **Prioritize ruthlessly** - Everything can't be MVP
3. **Define "not building"** - Scope clarity prevents scope creep
4. **Set measurable goals** - "Better UX" isn't measurable

## What Happens Next

After completing this questionnaire:
1. Review the generated PRD and Roadmap
2. Run `/bootstrap-architecture` for Phase 2 (Technical Architecture)
3. The System Architect will reference your PRD for technical decisions

### Output Format
