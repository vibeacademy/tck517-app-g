"""Health check endpoints.

`/api/health` — fast probe used by Cloud Run readiness checks. Does NOT
touch the database (Neon cold-wake on every probe is expensive).

`/api/health/db` — DB-backed probe used by the preview-deploy smoke test
to verify the deploy actually has a working database connection. Added
in #78 because preview deploys without Neon configured were passing
the no-DB `/api/health` probe and shipping a broken URL.
