# Agile Flow - Claude Code Project Template

## >>> CRITICAL RULES — Read These First <<<

1. **Never commit directly to `main`.** All work on feature branches (`feature/issue-{number}-short-description`). All changes through pull requests.
2. **All tests must pass before pushing.** Never use `git push --no-verify`. Fix the failing checks instead.
3. **Conventional commits required.** Format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`. See `.claude/skills/commit.md` for types and scopes.
4. **Only humans merge PRs.** Agents create PRs and review them. Humans approve and merge.
5. **Solo mode is the default.** A fork's gh + git operations use the user's personal account. Set `AGILE_FLOW_WORKER_ACCOUNT` and `AGILE_FLOW_REVIEWER_ACCOUNT` env vars to opt into multi-bot mode (separation of duties, appropriate for production teams with provisioned bot accounts). The `.claude/hooks/ensure-github-account.sh` hook handles account switching for multi-bot mode automatically.
6. **No emojis in ASCII tables.** They break column alignment. Emojis OK in prose and headings.
7. **One canonical location per fact.** Don't duplicate content across CLAUDE.md, agent files, and skills.
8. **Never hardcode application URLs.** Use `window.location.origin` (client-side) or request headers (server-side) so code works in both production and PR preview environments.

## Critical Requirements

> **TL;DR:** Trunk-based dev, quality-driven workflow, pre-push verification.

### Trunk-Based Development (REQUIRED)

- `main` branch is protected — no direct commits
- All work on short-lived feature branches
- Branch naming: `feature/issue-{number}-short-description`
- PRs require review before merge, keep branches short-lived (< 1 day)

The agent workflow depends on this:

1. `github-ticket-worker` creates feature branches and PRs
1. `pr-reviewer` reviews PRs (cannot merge — human does)
1. Human performs final review and merge

### Pre-push Hook (REQUIRED)

```bash
git config core.hooksPath scripts/hooks
```

The hook auto-detects the language stack and runs lint + tests before push.
**`--no-verify` is forbidden.**

### Quick Fix Protocol

For changes under 20 lines that don't alter behavior (broken imports, lint
errors, typos): skip ticket ceremony but still use branch + PR.

---

## Agent Configuration

> **TL;DR:** 6 agents with non-overlapping authority. Worker and reviewer
> have NON-NEGOTIABLE PROTOCOL blocks. Only humans merge.

| Agent | Role | Owns | Cannot Do |
|-------|------|------|-----------|
| Product Manager | Strategy | Vision, go/no-go, feature eval | Backlog management |
| Product Owner | Tactics | Backlog, tickets, priorities | Strategic decisions |
| Ticket Worker | Implementation | Code, tests, PRs | Merge PRs |
| PR Reviewer | Quality Gate | Code review, recommendations | Merge PRs |
| Quality Engineer | Validation | Test plans, reports | Implementation |
| System Architect | Design | Architecture, patterns | Implementation |

### Account model

This template supports two modes. **Solo mode is the default** for new
forks; multi-bot mode is the production opt-in.

**Solo mode (default)** — one personal account plays all roles
(worker, reviewer, human merger). Recommended for workshops, tutorials,
individual learners, and framework evaluation. Bootstrap with
`bash scripts/setup-solo-mode.sh` (see `docs/GETTING-STARTED.md`).
Activated by `AGILE_FLOW_SOLO_MODE=true` (set automatically in
Codespaces via `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`).

**Multi-bot mode (production)** — separate worker + reviewer bot
accounts plus a human merger. Provides separation of duties and an
audit trail. Requires bot account provisioning
(`scripts/setup-accounts.sh`). Activated by setting
`AGILE_FLOW_WORKER_ACCOUNT` (default: `va-worker`) and
`AGILE_FLOW_REVIEWER_ACCOUNT` (default: `va-reviewer`) env vars.
The `.claude/hooks/ensure-github-account.sh` hook auto-switches to
the right account before `gh pr create` and `gh pr review`.

Choose based on use case, not phase. Workshop attendees stay in solo
mode for the entire workshop. Production teams adopt multi-bot once
they have provisioned bot accounts and a documented PAT-rotation
schedule.

### GitHub CLI (`gh`)

Agents use the `gh` CLI for all GitHub operations (issues, PRs, reviews,
board ops). In solo mode, `gh` operates as the user's personal account
throughout. In multi-bot mode, each bot account authenticates via
`gh auth login` and the `.claude/hooks/ensure-github-account.sh` hook
switches to the correct account automatically before PR creation and
review operations.

### MCP Servers

MCP servers are defined in `.mcp.json` (project root). The bootstrap
wizard creates this file automatically. Configure allowed tools in
`.claude/settings.local.json` (see `.claude/settings.template.json`).

| Server | Required | Token |
|--------|----------|-------|
| `memory` | Yes | none |
| `sequential-thinking` | No | none |

## Formatting Standards

> **TL;DR:** No emojis in tables, GitHub-flavored markdown, code blocks
> with language specifiers.

- No emojis inside ASCII tables (they break alignment)
- Use GitHub-flavored markdown with clear heading hierarchy
- Code blocks with language specifiers
- Tables for structured data

### Agent Output Format

Every agent output MUST follow these patterns. Full spec: `docs/AGENT-OUTPUT-STANDARD.md`

**Result Block** — every completed action ends with:

```
---

**Result:** <one-line outcome>
<key-value pairs, one per line>
```

**Progress Lines** — multi-step workflows report each step:

```
→ Step completed
✗ Step failed — see output above
```

**Standard Vocabulary** — use these terms only, no synonyms:

| Category | Terms |
|----------|-------|
| Decisions | GO / NO-GO / CONDITIONAL |
| Status | On Track / At Risk / Blocked |
| Findings | Required change (blocking) / Suggestion (non-blocking) |
| Effort | S (1-4h) / M (0.5-2d) / L (2-5d) / XL (5+d) |

**GitHub References** — first mention: `#N — title`. Subsequent: bare `#N`.

**Section Order** (multi-section reports): Context → Findings → Recommendations → Result Block

### Definition of Ready

A ticket is ready when it has: clear title, description with context,
testable acceptance criteria, effort estimate, priority label, no blockers.

### Definition of Done

A ticket is done when: all acceptance criteria met, code reviewed and
approved, tests passing, no lint errors, PR merged to main.
